# Recording a PowerPoint slideshow

Microsoft PowerPoint allows you to record the timings, narration (with a microphone) and annotations like the "laser pointer" feature, and export them as video.


- To begin recording, in the top toolbar select SlideShow, then Record Slideshow.

- You will be prompted what aspects of the presentation you want to record. You'll want to record both the timings, and the narration.

- Simply go through your presentation. Be aware that the audio is not recorded during a transition between slides, and that your mouse movements will not be recorded, unless you use, for example, the "laser pointer" feature. This can be found in a menu down the bottom of the slide, or by holding the control key, and clicking.

- Once you have finished your presentation, the recording will finish automatically.

- To get the video, go to File -> Export -> Create a video. You'll want to use the recorded timings, and produce a video of good resolution.

- The video can take some time to render. You can see the progress in the status bar at the bottom of the window.
