# Creating your videos

There are a number of ways to create video presentations. Producing pre-recorded presentations gives you a huge amount of flexibility to produce interesting media, however, taking full advantage of this can be difficult and time-consuming. Here are a few methods of turning the traditional slideshow presentations you're used to, into videos for the symposium. 

- If you're using Microsoft PowerPoint to create slides, you can [record your presentation](power.md).

- If you've become familiar with Zoom over the COVID-19 epidemic, you can [record yourself screen sharing](zoom.md).

- You can also use online [screen capture tools](screencap.md)


# The recording process

Here are a few tips to help make life easier:

- Leave yourself a few seconds of recording before you start, and after you finish. There's nothing worse than losing part of your message because you're trying to cut the video too precisely.

- Make trial runs. It can be rough if you've just aced your presentation, but didn't have the recording set up the way you needed. Do a test run first, and make sure things are as you expect.

# Amazing Presentations

Getting your message across can be hard, but here are a few great resources to investigate

- The Craft of Scientific Presentations by Michael Alley. This book is a fairly comprehensive look at the art of communicating with your audience. Extracting even a few of the ideas from this book, especially the "assertion-evidence framework" can add a punch to your presentation. Check your university library, as it likely can be downloaded free of charge.

- [How to avoid death by PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo), by David JP Phillips - This TEDx talk is a brief glimpse at some of the common key problems with presentation slides, and how to make major improvements quickly.
