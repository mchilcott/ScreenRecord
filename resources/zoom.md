# Recording a screen share on Zoom

Assuming you have the zoom client installed and have a zoom account, you can record giving a presentation regardless of anyone watching the zoom meeting.


- Start a new meeting, e.g. using your personal meeting ID.
- Share your screen.
- Select to record from the bar at the top of your screen (depending on your screen size, this may be accessible from the "More" button)
- Once you have completed your presentation, select to "Stop Recording", then "End Meeting", after which you will be informed that the recording is being converted.
- The video will now appear in your recordings folder, which is Documents/Zoom by default. To change this, go to Settings (click on the cog) -> Recording and change the location.
