# Screen Recorder
 
This project is an experiment in recording the [screen](screen-only/)
 and system audio from the web browser.
 
Curently has no error handling. :(
 
Eventually, want to extend this to [capturing the webcam and microphone](webcam-only/) to overlay. For the purposes of recording presentations.
